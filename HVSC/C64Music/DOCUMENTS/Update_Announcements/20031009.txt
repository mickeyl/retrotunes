Hello everyone,

HVSC Update #36 is now available for you to download at
www.hvsc.c64.org!

-----------
What's new:
-----------
This time we have the compo tunes from SidWine2, Vision 2003,
North Party 8 and LCP 2003, among others.

Also we managed to add a lot of classical game tunes, many of which
have been ripped on the recently held Ripcompo.

We also ensured that all the Protovision releases are now featured
in HVSC, which means we added It's Magic 2, Team Patrol and others.


------------
What's next?
------------
The forthcoming HVSC update will be released shortly before
Christmas. And as you probably know, the Christmas update has ever
been something very special. I don't want to spoil the surprise
too much, but here's a little of what you can expect:

o  Lots of RSID fixes of the above /VARIOUS composers (you probably
   realized that we added next to none of those to this update, to
   give the composers in /VARIOUS a higher priority)
o  More Blues Muz' worktunes (some real gems among those!)
o  New tunes by old masters we managed to dig up in the Compunet.
o  more fixes and credit corrections, as always.

...and much more!

Thanks to all the people who have helped to make HVSC the

a much tougher task.

Sidplay2/w updated
------------------
Sidplay2/w has been updated, with numerous emulation improvements.
Get it now at http://www.d.kth.se/~d93-alo/c64/spw/
At the moment this is the best way to listen to SID music with
software based emulation!


---------------------------
ACID 64 SID Player released
---------------------------
A new SID player was released this summer by Wilfred Bos.
It's called ACID 64 Player and it plays SID tunes
through the HardSID or the Catweasel MK3 Flipper card.
The player is only available for Windows.

Some features:
- on the fly switching between devices
- real muting of voices
- voice signal indicator
- fast forward up to 20 times
- background playing
- and much more!

The author is already working on the next generation of ACID 64:
It will be cycle based and able to play digis and other RSID tunes.

The player can be downloaded at http://www.acid64.com/


----------------------------------------------
New SID player for Atari STE/Falcon computers
----------------------------------------------
There's a new SID player for Atari STE/Falcon computers named JAM!
Apart from .sid files it is capable of playing a wide range of
formats, Amiga and Atari XL/XE music included.

Incidentally, there also exists a JAM player for Windows, and it's
capable of playing SNDH (Atari ST music) files only; yet still it's
recommended if you'd like to listen to Atari ST chipmusic, because
sound quality offered by JAM is, as for now, unbeatable if compared
to other Atari ST music players (STSound etc.).
You can download both Atari STE/Falcon and Windows JAM from
http://www.creamhq.de.


------------------------------------
composers.c64.org got a major update
------------------------------------
The whole site is now database driven, which enables a lot of
funky features, such as sorting or detailed search functions.
But not only the functionality has increased significantly, the
layout has been overhauled completely and is now much more user-
and eyefriendly.  ;-)

To make things complete 52 composers were added, and Peter Sandén
gathered 28 new or better photos of SID music composers.

Check it out!

---------------------
VICE updated to V1.13
---------------------
The ball keeps on rolling! The popular multiplatform emulator Vice
has seen another update.

Feature enhancements and additions include:
Support for TFE and the RR-Net addon cards was added, HardSID is now
supported and the broken Catweasel support from V1.12 was fixed.
Drives can be reset separately and a strange keyboard bug concerning
the cursor keys was fixed. A fix of the NMI line emulation bug now
makes Vice more compatible than ever and it surely can be seen as top
choice for the demowatchers.

-------------------------------
GameBase64 is finally released after 5 long years of hard work! The
release comes with over 15000 games, 23000 screenshots and integrates
seamlessly with the HVSC! The PC frontend for GB64 also doubles as a
frontend for the HVSC and offers advanced searching and filtering for
both games and SIDs.

Check it out at the GB64 website at http://www.gb64.com/

SidAsm 1.0 released
-------------------
SidDasm V1.0 by Gufino was released at CovertBitops in the Tools
section. The program produces disassembler output of .SID music
files, so that you’ll be able to see the musicroutine code.
Both DOS version & Linux version are available for download, with
source code included.

BIT Live Brighton huge success
------------------------------
Look what you've missed:

o  Rob Hubbard performed an acoustic set for one hour to standing
   ovations.
o  The new group "Stuck in D'80s" with Ben Daglish, Reyn Ouwehand,
   Marcel Donné, Andreas Wallstrom and top violinist
   Mark "madfiddler" Knight performed a rocking set.
o  Press Play on Tape performed a huge set live on stage.
o  Finishing up with a supergroup consisting of PPOT, Ben Daglish,
   Rob Hubbard and Mark Knight all playing Monty on the Run!
o  Martin Galway also starred at BITLive for the launch of his new
   double CD Project: Galway, which is a hit as always!
o  Project: Galway, an audio CD double set of Martin Galway's SIDs
   recorded from Martin's own development SID chip shows off how the
   tunes should sound, and introduces the newly unearthed "Streethawk"
   music, long thought lost but recompiled from his source code by
   Project leader "Alistair 'Boz' Bowness".
   Martin says he's delighted that people can listen to his work as
   clearly now as they could in 1987...
   Two CD picturedisks with full colour booklet, full of great trivia
   and info, some from Martin himself (none of it taken from STIL)
   are waiting to delight your ears!
   The CD can be ordered from
   http://www.c64audio.com/theshop/pages/sidcds.htm
o  Nexus 6581-II was also released at Back in Time Live:
   An EP from Reyn Ouwehand, who has turned his hand to Bombo,
   Thanatos, Pimple Squeezer and Tiger Mission:
   Two fast tunes and two slow tunes played by the master himself...!
   So good two of the tunes formed the backbone of "Stuck in D'80s",
   along with Deflektor from Nexus 6581, Way of the Exploding Fist
   and Paperboy.
