Resulting Version: 57
 Previous Version: 56

Hello fellow lover of SID music!
Nice you found some time to read through this script, to see what has been
changed in the HVSC and for what reason.

After this update, the collection should contain 42,212 SID files!

This update features (all approximates):
     975 new SIDs
     239 fixed/better rips
      13 repeats/bad rips eliminated
    3136 SID credit fixes
     396 SID model/clock infos
      38 tunes from /DEMOS/UNKNOWN/ identified
      18 tunes from /GAMES/ identified
      72 tunes moved out of /DEMOS/ to their composers' directories
      24 tunes moved out of /GAMES/ to their composers' directories

We are always looking for others to help make HVSC a better collection.
If you find any errors or have new rips to add, please email:

 iAN CooG  <hvsc@c64.org>


Thanks to all the people who have helped to make HVSC the
collection that it is today, without your help it would be
a much tougher task.

Jeri Ellsworth showed a Commodore 64 based bass guitar at the
"Bay Area Maker Fair". She combined a bass guitar with a C64 and a FPGA system.
The FPGA system reads the signals from the guitar strings and the C64 keyboard.

# SID Known v1.04 #
###################

Wilfred Bos has released SID Known v1.04. This version supports now HVSC #57.
SID Known is a command line tool which you can use to identify SID tunes from
SID and PRG files.

This tool can be used if e.g. you want to know which SID tune is used in a
specific C64 demo or C64 game, or you have a SID tune found or ripped and you
want to know if it is already in your SID collection.

SID Known can be used to identify music but it also helps to find out which
tunes are not in the High Voltage SID Collection. If you find music not found
by SID Known, it would be appreciated if you report this to the HVSC crew
(http://hvsc.de) or post it in one of the CSDb forums (http://csdb.dk) like
"SIDs that aren't in HVSC yet".
