# ACID64 player v3.0.4 has been released #
##########################################

ACID 64 is a cycle based player for Windows that can play SID tunes on sound
devices with a real SID chip and via network devices that emulate the SID chip,
like JSidDevice that is part of JSidplay2. It has nice features such as seeking
through SIDs immediately, song length database (SLDB) support and incremental
search features.

Changes in version 3.0.4:

New
- Added native support for JSidplay2 and JSidDevice
- No more real SID chip device needed. Just start the jsiddevice.exe and
  Acid64 will play sids! Hardsid4U is still highly recommended if you want
  best sound quality, though.

Improvements
- Faster startup time
- Emulation improvements
- Copy file/directory added to context menu
- Many small improvements

Fixes
- ACID64 couldn't start on some Windows 7 64 bit machines
- Turning filter off and seek back turned filter on
- Switching device and then seeking could silent the tune
- Fast forward could freeze GUI in some cases
