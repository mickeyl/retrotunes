# FPGASID available and firmware update 0.A #
#############################################

The FPGASID project is a hardware project that simulates the SID chip with an
FPGA chip. It aims for a better SID than any SID has ever been before. The
FPGASID board is now available and can be ordered here:

https://webstore.kryoflux.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=63

Also, firmware update 0.A has been released with the following changes:

- New 6581 bias setting range and curve. Per default the bias is now tuned to a
  brighter sound which is the most audible difference to revision 09.
- Some further improvements on the 6581 filters.
- LEDs can be switched off now.
- The outputs can be switched to a mix of both SIDs allowing mono setups with a
  single speaker.
- The firmware flashing procedure has been improved to increase success rate.
- FPGASID is now compatible to the EasyFlash 3 module.

# ARM2SID #
###########

ARM2SID is the successor of ARMSID which is a replacement of the MOS6581 and
MOS8580 sound chip used in the Commodore C64. It is minimalistic (in simplicity
of circuit and use, not in function and power). ARM2SID can now emulate up to
two additional chips and/or a FM synthesis with OPL2.

Features:

- SIDs emulation is the same as with ARMSID.
- It can replace up to 3 chips at the same time.
- It can emulate SFX sound expander as the newer FM-YAM clone.
- Firmware update possible inside the C64/C128.

Specification:

- A few resistors, capacitors, one stabilizer, one opamp and a processor.
- STM32F446 processor (180MHz almost two times faster than ARMSID).
- 2x more FLASH memory and 4x more RAM, more pins than ARMSID.
- 2x 12bit DAC.
- The analogue output is provided by the AD8646 audio amplifier (now in stereo).
- The 3.3V stabilizer, the processor itself has 5V tolerant inputs.
- There is an expansion connector on the board, you can either connect a second
  socket to it with a second control signals (chip-select and R/W) plus a second
  audio output or you can connect the connector to the appropriate signals on
  the computer board directly without another socket (especially if the computer
  hasn't a second socket).

# Ultimate-64 Elite #
#####################

The Ultimate 64 Elite is a new main board for your beloved C64 case. This board
is a hardware implementation (FPGA) of the entire C64, and it includes the
Ultimate-II+ cartridge as well. An all-in-one solution.

Differences between "Elite" and the "regular" Ultimate-64:

- The Elite board has ZIF sockets with gold plated contacts for the SID chips.
- The Elite board is completely jumperless.
- An additional difference is that the unit has a boxed (shrouded) header for
  the UserPort expansion, which reduces the risk of shorting the 12V line to a
  data line and blowing up the U64 board.
- The color of the board is black.
- The Elite board has a joystick swap switch, to swap port 1 and 2 easily.

# SID Known v1.17 #
###################

Wilfred Bos has released SID Known v1.17. This version supports now HVSC #71.
SID Known is a command line tool which you can use to identify SID tunes from
SID and PRG files.

This tool can be used if e.g. you want to know which SID tune is used in a
specific C64 demo or C64 game, or you have a SID tune found or ripped and you
want to know if it is already in your SID collection.

SID Known can be used to identify music but it also helps to find out which
tunes are not in the High Voltage SID Collection. If you find music not found
by SID Known, it would be appreciated if you report this to the HVSC crew
(https://hvsc.de) or post it in one of the CSDb forums (https://csdb.dk) like
"SIDs that aren't in HVSC yet".
