# Music Studio 2.2.0.3 #
########################

Music Studio is an open-source Windows-based SID music creator software. It uses
RESID-FP for SID emulation, both old (6581) and new (8580) SID chips. Music
Studio is capable of creating 1x speed tunes and alternate many SID chip
parameters directly with various commands. Classic and new C64 sounds can be
created with envelope parameters that can be set up in a few simple steps.

Changes in this release:

- Fixed a small output bug that would generate a lone "!by" for any
  EnvelopesAttackDecay etc table.
- When choosing "play envelope" the song index should be forced to 0.
- Ticks value was not correctly set for Note Table command 1.
- Dynamic track/table/block quick help reference in the lower right-hand corner.

# Polyanna V1.00 #
##################

Polyanna is a 8-channel music editor for the Commodore 64 written by Aleksi
Eeben. It plays 3 regular SID channels together with 5 emulated SID channels on
a stock machine. Old SID chip (6581) is required.
The mixer is based on Sid Vicious, a SID emulator that Aleksi Eeben wrote for
VIC 20 in 2006. For optimal performance the emulated channels in Polyanna are
optimized for pulse waveform only. Pulse width modulation and envelopes are of
course supported, although they're rough.

##################
# Threesome V1.0 #
##################

Threesome is an alternate version of the Polyanna music editor written by
Aleksi Eeben. This editor has no emulated PWM voices and it uses 1 or 2
additional SID chips at addresses $DE00 and $DF00 instead.

# cSID #
########

Last year Hermit (Mihály Horváth) released jsSID which is written in
JavaScript. Now Hermit made cSID which is a SID player written in C. cSID is
more enhanced than the JavaScript version. The sound engine runs at 1Mhz and
it has 22x oversampling.

cSID can be downloaded here: http://csdb.dk/release/?id=153597

# cSID-light #
##############

Hermit (Mihály Horváth) released cSID-light. This cSID version is pretty much
enhanced with better 6581 filter emulation (with filter-distortion) and
playlist capabilities. Still operates in commandline (linux by default), and
eats much less CPU resource than the original cSID which clocks sound emulation
at 1MHz.
Most SIDs can be played with csidl fine though due to the non-cyclebased
operation ADSR can behave differently than on real machine.

The source code has a lot of comments in it which explains the internal workings
of the SID chip.

# SID Known v1.13 #
###################

Wilfred Bos has released SID Known v1.13. This version supports now HVSC #67.
SID Known is a command line tool which you can use to identify SID tunes from
SID and PRG files.

This tool can be used if e.g. you want to know which SID tune is used in a
specific C64 demo or C64 game, or you have a SID tune found or ripped and you
want to know if it is already in your SID collection.

SID Known can be used to identify music but it also helps to find out which
tunes are not in the High Voltage SID Collection. If you find music not found
by SID Known, it would be appreciated if you report this to the HVSC crew
(http://hvsc.de) or post it in one of the CSDb forums (http://csdb.dk) like
"SIDs that aren't in HVSC yet".

The following has been improved in this version:

- New DLL interface
- Increased performance
- Fixes thread locking issue for some CPUs
