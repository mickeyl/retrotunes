Merry HVSCmas SID fans, here we are with the 2nd favourite update of the year
with the usual loads of recently made tunes, old scavenged ones and tons of
better SID rips to keep you busy during the cold winter holidays.
Another milestone has been reached with 47,500 tunes, with a total of 650
made this year. Amazing.
This update is dedicated to Ramos/HVSC^Samar who suddenly passed away in
August, at the young age of 39. Thanks for everything, rest in peace and see
you in another life.

We are always looking for others to help make HVSC a better collection.
If you find any errors or have new rips to add, please email:

 iAN CooG  <hvsc (sid) c64.org>


Thanks to all the people who have helped to make HVSC the collection that it
is today, without your help it would be a much tougher task.

# SID Known v1.11 #
###################

Wilfred Bos has released SID Known v1.11. This version supports now HVSC #64.
SID Known is a command line tool which you can use to identify SID tunes from
SID and PRG files.

This tool can be used if e.g. you want to know which SID tune is used in a
specific C64 demo or C64 game, or you have a SID tune found or ripped and you
want to know if it is already in your SID collection.

SID Known can be used to identify music but it also helps to find out which
tunes are not in the High Voltage SID Collection. If you find music not found
by SID Known, it would be appreciated if you report this to the HVSC crew
(http://hvsc.de) or post it in one of the CSDb forums (http://csdb.dk) like
"SIDs that aren't in HVSC yet".
