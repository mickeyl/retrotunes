Stainless Steel
 -> Joe cooked up some brilliantly arranged remixes of recent pop hits
    for us.
Jeroen Tel
 -> Jeroen once again opened his treasure chest of unreleased tunes and
    gave the scene three "new" songs. But we also found a bit of old and
    forgotten stuff from him.
Xiny6581

    enforcement. Give these tunes some time, they don't release their
    message in the first 3 chords.
Zabutom
 -> Ha, only about a year ago he entered the stage and now he's working
    the sid like an orchestra that was made just for him! Wow!

# Fundamental directory structure change #
##########################################
  
  In this update the HVSC Crew decided to fundamentally overhaul the HVSC
  directory structure and re-sort it.
  There are a few disturbing things in the current HVSC directory structure:
  1. Inconsistencies to our own rule as to what is root and what is VARIOUS.
     There are composers in VARIOUS that, according to our rules should be in
     the root and vice versa.
  2. With more and more composers surfacing and others getting their own
     directories by gathering their 3 tunes, the directory trees grew to huge
     sizes (several screens high), which made navigating and maintaining a bit
     cumbersome.
  3. The term VARIOUS and the fact that the tunes inside that directory were 3
     directory levels further down than the glorious root composers was
     considered unfair by a lot of people. Discussions went in circles
     thinking about a better name (SCENE? POST_1993?) or to organize the root
     dir similiarly (CLASSICS? PRE_1993?), so we finally decided to go for a
     completely new sorting structure:

/DEMOS
 /0-9
 /A-F
 /G-L
 /M-R
 /S-Z
 /UNKNOWN
-> Sorting structure is now similiar to the /GAMES directory.
   No changes to the rules were made as to what goes into DEMOS.
   It's still the same, it contains tunes from demos made by composers
   that are either unknown or that have composed less than 3 tunes overall. 

/DOCUMENTS
-> No changes here

/GAMES
 /0-9
 /A-F
 /G-L
 /M-R
 /S-Z
-> Again, nothing changed apart from the added /0-9 subdirectory.
   The GAMES directory still contains tunes from games made by composers
   that are either unknown or that have composed less than 3 tunes overall. 

/MUSICIANS
 /0-9
 /A
 /B
 /C
...
-> Basically we've merged the root directory and the old VARIOUS directory,
   giving up the A-F/G-L/M-R/S-Z sorting and going for a plain alphabetic
   flat sorting structure. A composer still needs 3 or more tunes to get into
   the MUSICIANS directory, in order to avoid cluttering up HVSC with
   hundreds of directories that only contain one or two tunes.

We think we found an unbiassed and futureproof solution with that new sorting
structure: It's easier to maintain. It's easier to navigate. It's more fair:
No more discussions about "why is composer x in the root, shouldn't he be in
VARIOUS?" or "composer y made 3 gametunes before '93, shouldn't he be in the
root?".
In addition, an almost flat structure like that hopefully encourages one or
the other guy out there to program a proper frontend for HVSC one day.
Be it in form of a tool or a website interface, so people can conveniently
switch between several HVSC "views", assign "favourites" flags to tunes and
composers etc. If you've got the skills and the time/motivation to help us
in making this vision reality, drop us a mail at hvsc@c64.org.
Especially a motivated webdesigner with PHP/MySQL knowledge would be a
welcome addition to the team. 

HVSC has grown almost too big to jump around in Windows Explorer without
getting lost, so we hope you get used to the new structure and like it
just as we do.
  
There were concerns that people new to HVSC would get lost in the new
structure as they are usually searching for their favourite game tunes from
back then, which basically boils down to: Hubbard, Galway, Follin and Tel. ;)
We think that people will still find what they're looking for, only it takes
them a little longer than before. And who knows how many gems they may find
on their hunt for that old tune by randomly clicking into other composers
directories, which were previously buried in VARIOUS.

place a vote or comment on it. Enjoy!

# Stone Oakvalley's Authentic Sid Collection #
##############################################

The SOASC= project is an automated recording technique invented by Stone
Oakvalley in order to mass record music from the legendary Commodore 64 and
its SID chips (6581 and 8580).
The goal is to record EVERY tune from HVSC to MP3 from REAL C64s with the
help of a PC sending PSID64 files to the C64 and playing them back on both
the 6581 and the 8580 for the playing time specified in the Songlength
Database, which is included in HVSC.
A seemingly insane project resulting in around 400 GB of MP3 that you can
conveniently download from the project website www.6581-8580.com.
The whole project is private, noncommercial and freely available to anyone.
It closely follows the HVSC policies regarding respecting the original
copyrights and issues best summed up under the "fair use" term.

# Nelly Furtado's "Do It" contains large  #
# portions of GRG's "Acidjazzed Evening"! #
###########################################

We want to bring a blatant case of copyright theft to your attention.
Here's a short summary taken from http://www.c64audio.com/timbaland.php:

In 2000, Janne Suni ("Tempest") composed a piece called "Acid Jazzed Evening"
which was submitted to the Assembly 2000 Oldskool Music Competition, winning
1st place. The piece was composed in what is called "Mod" format, popular on
Amiga computers in the 90s and later also on PCs. Assembly is one of the
worlds oldest and largest annual demoparties. In 2000 there were 4-5000
visitors present at the event, and the associated TV footage from the event
was watched by 170,000 viewers on Helsinki HTV-cable-tv and on the Internet.
35,000 of these viewers were abroad.

In 2002, the C64 composer Glenn Rune Gallefoss, well known and respected
within the C64 community, produced a Commodore 64 version of this tune, with
Tempest's blessing.

In 2005, Timbaland produced a series of exclusive ringtones. One of these was
called "Block Party" its release, being US specific, passed unnoticed, but it
bore striking similarities to the 2002 cover of Acid Jazzed Evening.

In 2006, Nelly Furtado released her new album "Loose", to a rapturous
reception. Almost immediately Janne started to receive emails telling him of
a problem with the track "Do It" appearing to feature his song. In October
2006, the forum at Remix64.com noted the issue, becoming more and more
concerned about the apparent similarities in the course of the thread.

In January 2007, the story suddenly started to appear in blogs and forums,
such as digg.com, slashdot.org and on YouTube. After that, the story has
spread everywhere.

# SidTool, a new HVSC frontend #
################################

Gentlemen (and ladies), direct your eyes to a new SID application which
was released recently: SidTool!

What is it? Basically a frontend for Sidplay2/Tinysid and (get this!) the
Vice commandline player with its hifi quality but CPU eating resampling
modes!

Some SIDTool features:

    * First to Support WinVice for playing
    * Support Sidplay2 for playback
    * Support TinySID for playback
    * HardSID support via TinySID
    * Easy access to the entire High Voltage Sid Collection
    * Easy single-click interface
    * Songlength database support
    * Continuous play to discover SIDs unknown to you
    * Playlist support with ability to add certain subsongs
      (not supported by WinVice)
    * Experimental sid2midi support (sid2midi.exe not included)
    * Built in search function for filenames, STIL and SID-Header
    * STIL display
    * Built on .NET framework 2.0 (required)
    
It's a perfect tool if you want to explore HVSC without having to assemble
custom playlists first. Just navigate to a dir of choice, hit the
"continuous" checkbox and let it doodle in the background for hours. Also
great to switch between various players quickly or to generate your own
playlists. And not to neglect, STIL integration and offline search function.
If the HVSC Crew would have an award for really useful tools, this program
would get it. But we don't have one, so we just recommend it wholeheartedly.
:-)

collection.  If you find any errors or have new rips to add, please

Thanks to all the people who have helped to make HVSC the
