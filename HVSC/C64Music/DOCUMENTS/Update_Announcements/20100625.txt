# CCS64 V3.8 has been released #
################################

CCS64 V3.8 has been released. The following has been fixed/changed: 

- FIX: Fixed a bug in the sprite-to-sprite collision-detection register.
- FIX: Fixed a bug with the 'Windows' menu Options -> Video behaviour.
- FIX: Made the graphics-drawing routines multi-threaded, for better
       performance.
- FIX: Fixed a bug which caused the QuickLoad/QuickSave features to hang. 
- ADD: Two new Filter options, called CRT Television and CRT Monitor, which
       work only with the Window 2x screen mode and not with any other
       non-default video settings. These new Filter options include the
       after-lightening effect.
- INF: CCS64 V3.7 was compiled with Visual Studio 2008, which led to an
       in-compatibility with Windows 98/ME, but greater compatibility with
       Windows 7; when previous versions were compiled with Visual Studio
       2005, this had the opposite effect.
