High Voltage SID Collection: Update #62
Date: December 21, 2014

Resulting Version: 62
 Previous Version: 61

Hello fellow lover of SID music!
Nice you found some time to read through this script, to see what has been
changed in the HVSC and for what reason.

After this update, the collection should contain 46,056 SID files!

This update features (all approximates):
     639 new SIDs
     168 fixed/better rips
       1 repeats/bad rips eliminated
     181 SID credit fixes
       7 SID model/clock infos
       7 tunes from /DEMOS/UNKNOWN/ identified
       5 tunes from /GAMES/ identified
      20 tunes moved out of /DEMOS/ to their composers' directories
       6 tunes moved out of /GAMES/ to their composers' directories

Although this is not a big update like previous ones, the goal of 46,000 SIDs
has been reached right in time for the release. The amount of new SIDs seems
less than other updates, but still there are a total of 650+ SIDs made in
2014, showing that the C64 scene is alive and kicking. Keep on composing!

We are always looking for others to help make HVSC a better collection.
If you find any errors or have new rips to add, please email:

 iAN CooG  <hvsc (sid) c64.org>


Thanks to all the people who have helped to make HVSC the collection that it
is today, without your help it would be a much tougher task.

# SID Known v1.09 #
###################

Wilfred Bos has released SID Known v1.09. This version supports now HVSC #62.
SID Known is a command line tool which you can use to identify SID tunes from
SID and PRG files.

This tool can be used if e.g. you want to know which SID tune is used in a
specific C64 demo or C64 game, or you have a SID tune found or ripped and you
want to know if it is already in your SID collection.

SID Known can be used to identify music but it also helps to find out which
tunes are not in the High Voltage SID Collection. If you find music not found
by SID Known, it would be appreciated if you report this to the HVSC crew
(http://hvsc.de) or post it in one of the CSDb forums (http://csdb.dk) like
"SIDs that aren't in HVSC yet".
