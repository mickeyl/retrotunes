Hello everyone,

HVSC Update #37 is now available for you to download
at www.hvsc.c64.org

After this update, the collection should contain 23,453 SID files!

This update features (all approximates):
    1977 new SIDs
      97 fixed/better rips
     219 fixes of PlaySID/Sidplay1 specific SIDs
       7 repeats/bad rips eliminated
     197 SID credit fixes
      86 tunes moved out of /DEMOS to their composers' directories
       4 tunes from /DEMOS/UNKNOWN identified  :-)
      15 tunes moved out of /GAMES to their composers' directories
      
It's Christmas time again, and like every year we have prepared something
very special for you all:
Not only do we bring you  2 2 8 0  SID tunes (of which almost 2 0 0 0 are new
ones), but we also decided that it's not much use having hundreds of digi rips
lying around in our Unreleased archive. So for all the people who are
listening to SID music on a real C64 this might be good news:
We added all 219 RSID fixes of PSID specific rips in HVSC!
Most, if not all of them are digi tunes, keep in mind that they can only
be listened to on a real C64 or Sidplay2.

Also be sure to check out Martin Galway's directory after the update:
Thanks to Chris Abbott's great connection to Martin Galway and
Alistair "Boz" Bowness ripping skills we can finally present you the
probably most sought after SID tune on this planet:
The long lost Street Hawk is here in two fantastic versions, one prototype
with less effects and the final version with bells and whistles that ought
to be used in the game.
And of course: Kudos to Martin Galway, who kindly provided his disks!

What more is there to discover in this update?

o A lot of new tunes from classic composers, such as 20CC, Neil Baldwin, Wally
Beben, Matthew Cannon, Mark Cooksey, Ian Crabtree, Deek, Danko, Geoff Follin,
Matt Gray, Stefan Hartwig, Ryo Kawasaki, Marcel Donné, Prosonix, Sonic
Graffiti, Jeroen Tel, Michael Winterberg and many more.

o But also some of the current scene composers have unveiled their old tunes
to us. Just to mention a few: Check out 4-Mat, Agemixer, Abaddon, Amorphis,
Arman Behdad, Blues Muz', Britelite, Cyberbrain, Daf, Decoy, Ed, Factor6,

Breakpoint 2003, Bronx $7d3, Primary Star 2003, Assembly 2003,
Scenecon '03 and TUM'02
(and a couple more compotunes we found along the way).

o Furthermore, we've now added the remainder of the tunes that have appeared in
the issues of the C64 disk magazine "Domination".

o To make HVSC friendlier to browse we added the following subdirectories:

/20CC:
======
/Paul_Falco
/van_Santen_Edwin

/FAME:
======
/Hendriks_Michael
/Knipping_Holger

/Rockin_Limited:
================
/Schaefers_Joerg

/SoedeSoft:
===========
/Soede_Jeroen
/Soede_Michiel

/VARIOUS/M-R/Mitch_and_Dane:
============================
/Dane
/Mitch

It looks nice and clean now and allows everybody to keep track of their favourite composers easier.  :-)

/VARIOUS/M-R/Megastyle/
=======================
The Megastyle musicians Rage, Crockett, Scroll, Lizard and Drumtex wished to be hosted under one roof, so we moved /VARIOUS/G-L/Lizard/ and /VARIOUS/M-R/Rage/ to the Megastyle directory.

New HVSC administrator
----------------------
From this update on Stephan 'Steppe' Schmid has taken over the HVSC administrator position from Jan Diabelez Arnt Harries. Jan stepped back from it due to a shift in real life priorities, which is perfectly understandable.
The whole team would like to express their thanks for the great work he did in the last two update periods.
Jan will stay in the team and continue to do his quality rips and fixes, if time allows.

New HVSC e-mail adress
----------------------

Slaygon kindly established an e-mail forwarder for us. It's easy to remember and it will reach two people at the same time: Stephan Schmid & Peter Sandén.
Please update your adress books to 

HVSC Administration <hvsc@c64.org>

instruments such as flutes, Guitars, Bass, Drums, Violins and five different

JC64Dis beta 1 released
-----------------------
JC64Dis is a java application of the project JC64 java C64 emulator
that disassembles a prg/sid/mus file, giving comments to memory locations.
In this version, it uses a patched sidld (sid Length Detector) for managing
its memory state. This means that it can tell you which part of a tune is
the player and which is the note data.
