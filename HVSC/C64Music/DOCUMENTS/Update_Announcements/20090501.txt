High Voltage SID Collection Update 50
Date: May 01, 2009

Resulting Version: 50
 Previous Version: 49

Hello fellow lover of SID music!
Nice you found some time to read through this script, to see what has been
changed in the HVSC and for what reason.


After this update, the collection should contain 36,000 SID files!

 This update features (all approximates):
      678 new SIDs
       59 fixed/better rips
      573 PlaySID/Sidplay1 specific SIDs eliminated
      189 repeats/bad rips eliminated
      482 SID credit fixes
      135 SID model/clock infos
       15 tunes from /DEMOS/UNKNOWN/ identified
       10 tunes from /GAMES/ identified
       36 tunes moved out of /DEMOS/ to their composers' directories
       11 tunes moved out of /GAMES/ to their composers' directories


As you can see, a great amount of files were eliminated in this update.
We decided to remove all the old _PSID files that have a RSID equivalent.
Those _PSID files were only hacks meant for digitized sounds to be played in
Sidplay1, but not on real C64. The _PSID files will be eliminated in every
future releases as soon as new RSID versions of the same .sid files are added.
For those still needing the _PSID files we have put them in a separate archive:

We are always looking for others to help make HVSC a better collection. If you
find any errors or have new rips to add, please email:

 Jan Harries, iAN CooG  <hvsc@c64.org>


Thanks to all the people who have helped to make HVSC the
collection that it is today, without your help it would be
a much tougher task.

Rambones demonstrates the phenomenon known as multispeed SID sounds.

Remember!: it sounds better on a real C64! SID 6581 used, it can do distortion.
