Hello everyone,

HVSC Update #38 is now available for you to download
at www.hvsc.c64.org

After this update, the collection should contain 25,149 SID files!

This update features (all approximates):
    1695 new SIDs
     126 fixed/better rips (129 SIDs)
       2 fix of PlaySID/Sidplay1 specific SIDs
       9 repeats/bad rips eliminated
     106 SID credit fixes
     280 SID model infos
      18 tunes moved out of /DEMOS to their composers' directories
       7 tunes from /DEMOS/UNKNOWN identified  :-)
      19 tunes moved out of /GAMES to their composers' directories
      (and 3 go back into /GAMES due to a wrongly credited tune)

      
This time we bring you:

o another dose of 1000+ new SIDs, in an effort to finally clean out our
  Unreleased archive. And it's still not empty yet...  [sigh!]

o Like always we present all the latest scene releases, such as from demos and
  musiccollections that were released since christmas.
  
o The music compo tunes from several parties: Xmas Compo 2003, Deadline 2003,
  TUM 2003 and Out Of Orderia 2003 (hope I didn't forget anything important).
  
o You probably already noticed it, but it's worth stating again:
  The High Voltage SID Collection has reached the magical 25,000 mark! Who
  would have thought we would ever come this far? Only a couple of years ago
  we were thinking about if we would ever reach the 15,000 limit. How naive!
  :-)
  
  Let's start the race towards the 30,000, the support of you, the SID music
  lovers, shall be the wind in our back. 
  Please keep up sending tunes, notify us of missing ones, let us know about
  bugged rips, submit your STIL entries. And I can promise you that the
  SIDoine will continue flowing through your blood vessels!  :-)

JC64Dis beta 1 released
-----------------------
JC64Dis is a java application of the project JC64 java C64 emulator
that disassembles a prg/sid/mus file, giving comments to memory locations.
In this version, it uses a patched sidld (sid Length Detector) for managing
its memory state. This means that it can tell you which part of a tune is
the player and which is the note data.
