High Voltage SID Collection: Update #66
Date: December 23, 2016

Resulting Version: 66
 Previous Version: 65

After this update, the collection should contain 48,943 SID files!

This update features (all approximates):
     430 new SIDs
      50 fixed/better rips
       3 repeats/bad rips eliminated
     201 SID credit fixes
      26 SID model/clock infos
       7 tunes from /DEMOS/UNKNOWN/ identified
       5 tunes from /GAMES/ identified
      22 tunes moved out of /DEMOS/ to their composers' directories
      10 tunes moved out of /GAMES/ to their composers' directories

We are always looking for others to help make HVSC a better collection.
If you find any errors or have new rips to add, please email:

 iAN CooG  <hvsc (sid) c64.org>

Thanks to all the people who have helped to make HVSC the collection that it
is today, without your help it would be a much tougher task.

# ESP8266 Wireless SID Project #
################################

Mark Baseggio created a wireless SID board based on the ESP8266 wireless SoC.
SID data is sent over the network to the wireless SID board to finally reach
the SID chip to produce the audio.

The project and source code can be found here:

# FPGASID alpha-phase #
#######################

The FPGASID project is a hardware project that emulates the SID chip with an
FPGA chip. It aims for a better SID than any SID has ever been before.
The new FPGASID prototype will become available in the beginning of 2017 and is
now in its alpha-phase.

Features:

Full SID Compatibility
- All registers implemented
- High quality Audio Filters
- Exact reproduction of the original 6581 chip sound

Stereo Support
- Two completely independent SID instances.
- Register selectable addresses for the second SID.
- Compatible to existing Stereo SID tunes.

Analog audio input
- Seldom used but required by some musicians and for special applications.

Paddle support
- Allows using Paddles or a Mouse with your C64.

JTAG interface for FPGA updates and debugging
- FPGA developers are encouraged to help with the debugging.

# SID Known Database Update #
#############################

For HVSC #66 a new database is generated for SID Known v1.12.
SID Known is a command line tool which you can use to identify SID tunes from
SID and PRG files.

This tool can be used if e.g. you want to know which SID tune is used in a
specific C64 demo or C64 game, or you have a SID tune found or ripped and you
want to know if it is already in your SID collection.

SID Known can be used to identify music but it also helps to find out which
tunes are not in the High Voltage SID Collection. If you find music not found
by SID Known, it would be appreciated if you report this to the HVSC crew
(http://hvsc.de) or post it in one of the CSDb forums (http://csdb.dk) like
"SIDs that aren't in HVSC yet".
