High Voltage SID Collection Update 48
Date:  March 09, 2008

Resulting Version: 48
Previous Version:  47

Hello fellow lover of SID music!
Nice you found some time to read through this script, to see what has been
changed in the HVSC and for what reason.

This time we have music from: Vandalism News 49, Silesia party,
The 82 Ditties demo by Bluez Muz, unreleased tunes by Adam Gilmore,
John Stormont (NEW), C64.sk SIDcompo 7, Aegis (aged sweet 13 years old!)
Jeroen Tel, Linus, Dwayne Bakewell, Richard Bayliss, Conrad (CRD),
Froyd, Adam Gilmore, Goto80


After this update, the collection should contain 35,030 SID files!

This update features (all approximates):
     918 new SIDs
      42 fixed/better rips
       0 fixes of PlaySID/Sidplay1 specific SIDs
      12 repeats/bad rips eliminated
     370 SID credit fixes
     101 SID model/clock infos
      11 tunes from /DEMOS/UNKNOWN/ identified  :-)
      37 tunes moved out of /DEMOS/ to their composers' directories
      15 tunes moved out of /GAMES/ to their composers' directories


We are always looking for others to help make HVSC a better
collection.  If you find any errors or have new rips to add, please
email:


  Jan Harries, Peter Sandén  <hvsc@c64.org>  


Thanks to all the people who have helped to make HVSC the
collection that it is today, without your help it would be
a much tougher task.

The resid filter distortion development has matured massively
#############################################################
Ever dreamed of getting these crackles and pops emulated, that you remember
from your real SID? It's within reach now, there's even a new version of
Sidplay2 in the works that integrates these patches. So far there are two
well balanced R4 filtersets and two additional filtersets with Galway's and
Follin's filters! And - now get this - there's even a program that allows
you to record your own C64 SID's filter characteristics and make your own
customized resid patch out of it. Stay tuned!

Hoxs64 emulator gets HVSC crew's recommendation for the best 8580 emulation.
############################################################################
The Hoxs64 emulator isn't just an ordinary C64 emulator to run games or demos
on, it also features a little known side feature - a sidplayer!
Just load up the .sid files as if they were a d64 or t64 file and Hoxs64 will
play it. It only emulates the 8580 revision of the SID chip, but that one
is probably as close to the real thing as it gets, even surpassing the quality
of the resid engine in Sidplay2. Make sure to have resampling enabled in the
options!
As an interesting bonus option the emulator features an 8580 digi boost, which
makes for example the PVCF tune in this update play as intended.

Kevin Horton's SID emulation with distortion in FPGA!
#####################################################
Kevin Horton, the hardware hacker extraordinaire (mostly known from his game
console hacking and the SIDman) is working on a SID implementation in FPGA.
Yes, it has been done before in eg. C64 DTV (which doesn't even emulate
filters), but his aim is to make the filters sound *very* exact to the real
thing, by actually implementing them OUTSIDE of the FPGA as a discrete circuit!
It is described in greater detail (with samples!) on his blog,
at http://blog.kevtris.org/

The filter circuit is based on the actual SID die, as imaged by Tim Boscke
(http://www.digital-circuits.org/sid/).

Kevin is looking for all kinds of info about different kinds/revisions of SID
chips, and also SID musicians with good ears to assist in filter tuning.
Actually, all kinds of help and information would be appreciated. Recordings
from additional real SID chips of the 'trickier' songs which use the filter
would also be much appreciated.

Another thing which might be of interest for you other hackers out there in
regards to his game console hacking, earlier SID player(s), and other FPGA work:
