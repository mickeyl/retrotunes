Resulting Version: 63
 Previous Version: 62

Hello fellow lover of SID music!
Nice you found some time to read through this script, to see what has been
changed in the HVSC and for what reason.

After this update, the collection should contain 46,851 SID files!

This update features (all approximates):
     798 new SIDs
     121 fixed/better rips
       3 repeats/bad rips eliminated
     412 SID credit fixes
      67 SID model/clock infos
       8 tunes from /DEMOS/UNKNOWN/ identified
      19 tunes from /GAMES/ identified
      24 tunes moved out of /DEMOS/ to their composers' directories
      22 tunes moved out of /GAMES/ to their composers' directories

It's summertime again, and as usual it's HVSC Update time aswell! More and
more new SID music is being produced everyday and as usual we are glad to
collect and bring them all to you, adding some corrections as we find them
or when we are reported about fixes to do.
Introducing 3SIDs from this release. See DOCUMENTS/SID_file_format.txt for
the specifications about new SID v4 file format. An updated SID player is
required. Known players which are already supporting the new format are:
ACID64 v3.6, JSIDPlay2 v3.6, VICE/VSID v2.4.20 rev. 29809.

We are always looking for others to help make HVSC a better collection.
If you find any errors or have new rips to add, please email:

 iAN CooG  <hvsc (sid) c64.org>


Thanks to all the people who have helped to make HVSC the collection that it
is today, without your help it would be a much tougher task.

# SID Known v1.10 #
###################

Wilfred Bos has released SID Known v1.10. This version supports now HVSC #63.
SID Known is a command line tool which you can use to identify SID tunes from
SID and PRG files.

This tool can be used if e.g. you want to know which SID tune is used in a
specific C64 demo or C64 game, or you have a SID tune found or ripped and you
want to know if it is already in your SID collection.

SID Known can be used to identify music but it also helps to find out which
tunes are not in the High Voltage SID Collection. If you find music not found
by SID Known, it would be appreciated if you report this to the HVSC crew
(http://hvsc.de) or post it in one of the CSDb forums (http://csdb.dk) like
"SIDs that aren't in HVSC yet".
