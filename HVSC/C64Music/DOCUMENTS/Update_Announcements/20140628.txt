High Voltage SID Collection: Update #61
Date: June 28, 2014

Resulting Version: 61
 Previous Version: 60

Hello fellow lover of SID music!
Nice you found some time to read through this script, to see what has been
changed in the HVSC and for what reason.

After this update, the collection should contain 45,418 SID files!

This update features (all approximates):
     749 new SIDs
    1479 fixed/better rips
       1 repeats/bad rips eliminated
     727 SID credit fixes
     323 SID model/clock infos
      19 tunes from /DEMOS/UNKNOWN/ identified
       4 tunes from /GAMES/ identified
      45 tunes moved out of /DEMOS/ to their composers' directories
       5 tunes moved out of /GAMES/ to their composers' directories

Yet another milestone reached: 45,000+ sids, and that happened just 2 months
after the previous update! Looks like the C64 musicians have infinite lives!

We are always looking for others to help make HVSC a better collection.
If you find any errors or have new rips to add, please email:

 iAN CooG  <hvsc (sid) c64.org>


Thanks to all the people who have helped to make HVSC the collection that it
is today, without your help it would be a much tougher task.

# SID Known v1.08 #
###################

Wilfred Bos has released SID Known v1.08. This version supports now HVSC #61.
SID Known is a command line tool which you can use to identify SID tunes from
SID and PRG files.

This tool can be used if e.g. you want to know which SID tune is used in a
specific C64 demo or C64 game, or you have a SID tune found or ripped and you
want to know if it is already in your SID collection.

SID Known can be used to identify music but it also helps to find out which
tunes are not in the High Voltage SID Collection. If you find music not found
by SID Known, it would be appreciated if you report this to the HVSC crew
(http://hvsc.de) or post it in one of the CSDb forums (http://csdb.dk) like
"SIDs that aren't in HVSC yet".
