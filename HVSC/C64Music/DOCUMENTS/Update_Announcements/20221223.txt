# ARMSID firmware 2.14 #
########################

A new firmware update has been released for the ARMSID and ARM2SID.

ARMSID/ARM2SID is a replacement of the MOS6581 and MOS8580 sound chip used in
the Commodore C64. It is minimalistic (in simplicity of circuit and use, not in
function and power).

The following has been changed in the ARMSID firmware:

- Fixed lower noise waveform tone pitch
- New configuration program

# Player Identifier v2.0 #
##########################

Wilfred Bos has released Player Identifier (Player-ID) v2.0. Player-ID is a
command line tool which you can use to identify Commodore 64 music players in
SID files.

Player-ID is inspired by the SIDId tool written by Cadaver of Covert Bitops. It
makes use of all available cores of the CPU and uses the BNDM search algorithm
to search through SID files very quickly.

Changes:

- Multi-platform support.
- Improved performance.
- -h option introduced. HVSC location needs to be specified with an environment
  variable.
- -n option introduced to display the info of a specific player.
- -v option for verifying signatures has a lot more checks and also verifies
  .nfo file.
- -t option added to truncate filenames. This option can be used if you want the
  output format to be the same as player-id v1.0.
- -i, -l, -w and -ic options are removed.
- -x option now shows each index of a sub signature when AND token is used.
- Token && can be used now which is the same as AND.
- END token is optional now but can still be used and is fully backward
  compatible.
- By default, when no END token is found, each signature ends at a line end.
- -wo and -wn option added to convert the signatures to the old/new format.
- Added tedid.cfg signatures for identifying players in Commodore C16, 116 and
  Plus/4 files.

able to play most RSID tunes and of course PSID tunes. It includes a
pre-compiled executable for Windows and Linux.

Changes since version 1.0:

- Enhanced sound quality with 7.4x oversampling and therefore much cleaner
  combined waveforms
- 4SID support (stereo/mono/middle is SID-Wizard compatible)

Network SID Device that emulates the Commodore 64 sound chip, a.k.a. SID chip
(6581/8580). It runs in a local network or on your own machine.

uses the emulation engine reSID 1.0 that is included in the Commodore-64
emulator Vice.

SID-Device has pre-compiled executables for Windows and Raspberry Pi OS.

Changes since 2.2.2 release:

- residfp: correct 6581 volume gain based on schematics
- residfp: updated the combined waveform model
- VIC II: check badline enabled condition on raster Y increment
- Disable digiboost for residfp when not required

# SID-Wizard v1.92 #
####################

Mihaly Horvath (Hermit) released a new version of SID-Wizard. SID Wizard is an
open-source C64 music tracker. This tracker runs on the C64 itself but since
version v1.9 also on Windows and Linux.

The following has been changed:

- Full 4SID support (used the new WebSID SID-format proposal)
- SID4 channels can be muted/unmuted by Shift+U/I/O
- Ctrl+E (C=+E) new pattern finder in order list was improved, it even looks in
  all subtunes for the highest-number used pattern.
- Date is added by PC-version of SIDmaker into the SID-file
- Shift+C is not possible after Ctrl+X (cut) in pattern-editor, this avoids
  corruption of pattern-length (when incorrect clipboard pasted by Ctrl+V)
- No more freeze in emulator, when accidentally pressing F3 when 'auto directory
  read' is disabled for saving
- Implemented Alt+F9 program-restart, just in case (e.g. if a freeze of the
  emulated SID-Wizard might happen due to some IO problems/etc.)

# FlexSID 1.2 #
###############

FlexSID is a music editor made by Mihaly Horvath (Hermit). FlexSID is primarily
a tool for you to create small footprint SID music. Yet it provides flexibility
and most features you usually need for good sound.

To reach this goal it's a bit different conceptually from the traditional music
trackers: diatonic scale-degree based notation system for better music-data
compression where it is possible, and the single command-oriented
instrument-table which is responsible for the small player-code size. The result
pretty much depends on the musician as well.

The editor is written in C (and some ca65 assembly), compiled with cc65 and gcc
with a quasi-emulated layer on top of SDL1.2, and therefore runs identically on
Linux (compiled for 64bit), Windows (compiled for 32bit) and of course C64.

The following has been changed:

- Better 7x oversampled waveforms (combined waveforms are much cleaner now)
- Ctrl+E (or C=+E on C64) to set the jump-target for a new instrument/FX easier
- Default pattern-length is now saved into the .flx workfile and restored when
  the tune is loaded
- the defMON sync-adapter is now supported and used if present on the real C64
- note-display mode, SID-model, relocation-target, default pattern-length are
  now loaded from the saved settings (config-file)

The following has been changed:

- MacBook keyboard insert support using option+backspace or fn+shift+backspace
- Deleting rows now works correctly on a MacBook keyboard
- Delete using fn + backspace on a MacBook keyboard
- Backspace works as expected when entering filenames
- Better support for some USB keyboards (unwanted characters)
- Build instructions for MacOS (see separate txt file)

# SID Known v1.24 #
###################

Wilfred Bos has released SID Known v1.24. This version supports now HVSC #78.
SID Known is a command line tool which you can use to identify SID tunes from
SID and PRG files.

This tool can be used if e.g., you want to know which SID tune is used in a
specific C64 demo or C64 game, or you have a SID tune found or ripped and you
want to know if it is already in your SID collection.

SID Known can be used to identify music but it also helps to find out which
tunes are not in the High Voltage SID Collection. If you find music not found
by SID Known, it would be appreciated if you report this to the HVSC crew
(https://hvsc.de) or post it in one of the CSDb forums (https://csdb.dk) like
"SIDs that aren't in HVSC yet".
