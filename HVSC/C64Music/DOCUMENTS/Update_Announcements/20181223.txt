Changes in this release:

- Bug fix: A pretty bad bug was fixed that might cause code corruption of
  different kinds, depending on a number of factors. The way the bug happened
  to manifest itself in the previous version, it caused filter sweeps and
  filter settings not to work as intended when using a 8580 SID.
- Bug Fix: In some versions saved worktunes sometimes turned out very large when
  saved to disk.

# SID Known v1.16 #
###################

Wilfred Bos has released SID Known v1.16. This version supports now HVSC #70.
SID Known is a command line tool which you can use to identify SID tunes from
SID and PRG files.

This tool can be used if e.g. you want to know which SID tune is used in a
specific C64 demo or C64 game, or you have a SID tune found or ripped and you
want to know if it is already in your SID collection.

SID Known can be used to identify music but it also helps to find out which
tunes are not in the High Voltage SID Collection. If you find music not found
by SID Known, it would be appreciated if you report this to the HVSC crew
(https://hvsc.de) or post it in one of the CSDb forums (https://csdb.dk) like
"SIDs that aren't in HVSC yet".
