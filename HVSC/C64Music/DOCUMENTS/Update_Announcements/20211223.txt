# Monty #
#########

Monty is a MIDI synth controller for the ATmega1284p which drives up to 2 6581
SID chips.

The software receives MIDI messages via UART (serial), tracking "note on",
"note off", "pitch bend" and other such MIDI commands. Up to 2 SID chips can be
controlled which totals 6 voices across 2 channels. Instrument definitions
decide which of the SIDs voice types to use, which include pulse wave (with
variable duty cycle), triangle wave, sawtooth wave, pseudorandom noise (white
noise). The SID chips also contain a filter and ring modulator. As was common
on the Commodore 64, software can then apply arpeggios and other register
manipulations to create more textured sounds.

More info can be found here: https://github.com/slipperyseal/monty

With the same hardware, the Monty on the Run tune from Rob Hubbard was converted
by cross assembling the 6502 code to AVR assembler, run the code on the
hardware, intercepting writes at $d4xx and send them to the real SID.

# SoedeSoft SIDMaster 1.3 #
###########################

Version 1.3 of SIDMaster has been released.

SIDmaster is a virtual synthesizer for the popular DAW: Reason. It emulates the
SID 6581 or SID 8580 sound chip of the popular Commodore 64 home computer of the
eighties and nineties.

SIDMaster is made by SoedeSoft who also made the music editor SoundMaster on the
Commodore 64 in the 80s.

Changes since version 1.1:

- Adding options to improve sound quality
- Extra filter feature
- Bugfixes
- Some new free patches
- Adding support for 8580 versions of the SID chip
- Combinator patches

# ARMSID firmware 2.13  #
#########################

A new firmware update has been released for the ARMSID.

ARMSID/ARM2SID is a replacement of the MOS6581 and MOS8580 sound chip used in
the Commodore C64. It is minimalistic (in simplicity of circuit and use, not in
function and power).

The following has been changed:

- Further optimization of code speed and size
- Also bus operations are faster, finally "paddles" are successfully read on
  NTSC machines even with the oldest HW versions of ARMSID!
- ARMSID start is faster. Instead of hundreds of milliseconds, ARMSID is fully
  functional in less than 15 milliseconds after power-up!
- Added the possibility to "fix" the so-called ADSR bug, i.e. a bug in the
  envelope generator, which is inherent to the original chips and is reproduced
  in ARMSID too. This is not needed in the C64 for compatibility reasons, but if
  you use ARMSID in synthesizers, you might be interested in this feature.
- Slightly modified quality (Q) of filter circuits for even more faithful
  reproduction of MOS8580.

- File watch handling when file in the current folder is renamed outside ACID64
- Muting all voices via keyboard media key didn't update checkboxes
- Muting voices and toggle filter on/off for 2SID and 3SID tunes

Improvements
- Startup performance

- Voice bar synchronization
- Latency correction option added per device type
- Less audible reset
- Support for multiple connected HardSID USB devices
- Error handling of HardSID USB devices

# Sidekick64 #
##############

Sidekick64 is a versatile cartridge/expansion for the C64, C128, and the C16/+4.
Its functionality is entirely defined by software running on a Raspberry Pi 3
(RPi). The connecting circuitry is quite simple and does not include any
programmable ICs.

Currently implemented features include the emulation of:

- GeoRAM/NeoRAM-compatible memory expansion
- Freezer cartridges
- Numerous bank switching cartridges
- C64 kernal replacement
- Function ROMs on a C128
- Multiple SIDs and Sound Expander/FM emulation (up to 8 SIDs)
- Simplified Datel and Sequential MIDI interface with built-in
  SoundFont-synthesizer (slightly modified version of TinySoundFont)
- TED-sound and Digiblaster emulation for C16/+4 (to have all sound devices on
  one output)

More info: https://github.com/frntc/Sidekick64

Recently Henning Pingel worked on a HVSC browser that can be accessed via the
Sidekick64 cartridge running a network-enabled kernel. It allows you to directly
browse through HVSC on the C64 and launch and playback any SID files on the C64.
Sidekick64 allows to convert a SID file directly to a PRG via PSID64 which is
used by the cartridge on the fly.

If you don't own a Sidekick64 cartridge, you can try out Sidekick64 and the HVSC
browser online:

Music Studio is an open-source Windows-based SID music creator software. It uses
RESID-FP for SID emulation, both old (6581) and new (8580) SID chips. Music
Studio is capable of creating 1x speed tunes and alternate many SID chip
parameters directly with various commands. Classic and new C64 sounds can be
created with envelope parameters that can be set up in a few simple steps.

Changes in this release:

- Improved the rip SID functionality to extract more of each instrument
  detected in the SID file
- Self playing demo includes extra scope effect

# SIDInfo 0.9.4 #
#################

SIDInfo is a simple utility written in C by Matti Hamalainen (ccr), that
displays information about SID files in various formats. Includes support for
PSID and RSID files versions 1-4, HVSC songlengths database and HVSC STIL
database.

Changes:

- Check for the validity of certain header fields in case of RSID and give
  indication in SID 'type' field if it is invalid
- Fix handling of the in-data load address, e.g. if PSID header load address
  field is 0, we should interpret first 2 bytes in data as load address. This
  had been broken when support for "new" SLDB MD5 format was added because it
  changed how the MD5 hash has to be calculated
- Finally remembered to add displaying of StartPage and PageLength attributes
  from PSIDv2NG headers
- Improvements in PSID parsing etc. robustness

# SID Known v1.22 #
###################

Wilfred Bos has released SID Known v1.22. This version supports now HVSC #76.
SID Known is a command line tool which you can use to identify SID tunes from
SID and PRG files.

This tool can be used if e.g. you want to know which SID tune is used in a
specific C64 demo or C64 game, or you have a SID tune found or ripped and you
want to know if it is already in your SID collection.

SID Known can be used to identify music but it also helps to find out which
tunes are not in the High Voltage SID Collection. If you find music not found
by SID Known, it would be appreciated if you report this to the HVSC crew
(https://hvsc.de) or post it in one of the CSDb forums (https://csdb.dk) like
"SIDs that aren't in HVSC yet".
