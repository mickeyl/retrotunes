# cSID-light 1.1 #
##################

Hermit (Mihály Horváth) released cSID-light version 1.1. This cSID version is
pretty much enhanced with better 6581 filter emulation (with filter-distortion)
and playlist capabilities. Still operates in command line (linux by default),
and eats much less CPU resource than the original cSID which clocks sound
emulation at 1MHz.
Most SIDs can be played with csidl fine though due to the non-cycle based
operation ADSR can behave differently than on real machine.

The source code has a lot of comments in it which explains the internal workings
of the SID chip.

Changes:

- 32bit Windows .exe (command line) and Linux executable is now included
- Calculated combined waveforms resemble more the original SID ones
- Distortion/clicking-fixes with 2SID/3SID loud tunes like Gliding Gladly
- Better illegal-opcode support including NOP #immediate and NOP absolute
- Zero-page-indexing wraparound 6502-CPU 'feature' support (if it's ever needed)
- Source-code improvements to prevent division-by-zero

# cRSID #
#########

cRSID is an open-source cycle based sidplayer made by Mihaly Horvath (Hermit).
This is an integer-only rewrite of cSID and cSID-light. The new sidplayer is
able to play most RSID tunes and of course PSID tunes. It includes a
pre-compiled executable for Windows and Linux.

# FlexSID 1.1 #
###############

FlexSID is a music editor made by Mihaly Horvath (Hermit). FlexSID is primarily
a tool for you to create small footprint SID music. Yet it provides flexibility
and most features you usually need for good sound.

To reach this goal it's a bit different conceptually from the traditional music
trackers: diatonic scale-degree based notation system for better music-data
compression where it is possible, and the single command-oriented
instrument-table which is responsible for the small player-code size. The result
pretty much depends on the musician as well.

The editor is written in C (and some ca65 assembly), compiled with cc65 and gcc
with a quasi-emulated layer on top of SDL1.2, and therefore runs identically on
Linux (compiled for 64bit), Windows (compiled for 32bit) and of course C64.

# SID-Wizard Emulator v1.9 #
############################

Mihaly Horvath (Hermit) released a new version of SID-Wizard with 'built-in'
emulation for ease of use and faster launching and IO-operations. This is the PC
version of SID-Wizard that is runnable from PC directly and can be associated to
.swm workfiles, in order to improve the workflow by shorter loading times and to
avoid d64-quirks. Current builds run on Windows and Linux.

# VICE 3.6.1 #
##############

VICE 3.6.1 has been released. VICE is an open source cross-platform emulator of
several Commodore machines.

VICE also includes VSID which can be used to play SID files.

SID/Audio related changes since VICE 3.5:

- Fixed sound buffer underrun behaviour, it will now cause a small glitch and
  no longer disable sound or flood the log with warnings
- Changing host audio settings no longer resets the emulated sound chip
- Added option to write out the raw data produced by reSID (for debugging)
- Made 48kHz the default for sound output, since that is what most modern stuff
  uses natively
- VSID: Fixed various issues with threading
- VSID: Implemented proper STOP of playback

# SID Known v1.23 #
###################

Wilfred Bos has released SID Known v1.23. This version supports now HVSC #77.
SID Known is a command line tool which you can use to identify SID tunes from
SID and PRG files.

This tool can be used if e.g. you want to know which SID tune is used in a
specific C64 demo or C64 game, or you have a SID tune found or ripped and you
want to know if it is already in your SID collection.

SID Known can be used to identify music but it also helps to find out which
tunes are not in the High Voltage SID Collection. If you find music not found
by SID Known, it would be appreciated if you report this to the HVSC crew
(https://hvsc.de) or post it in one of the CSDb forums (https://csdb.dk) like
"SIDs that aren't in HVSC yet".
