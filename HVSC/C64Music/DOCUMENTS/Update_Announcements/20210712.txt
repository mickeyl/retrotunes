High Voltage SID Collection: Update #75
Date: July 12, 2021

Resulting Version: 75
 Previous Version: 74

After this update, the collection should contain 54,387 SID files!

This update features (all approximates):
     729 new SIDs
      31 fixed/better rips
      11 repeats/bad rips eliminated
     314 SID credit fixes
      23 SID model/clock infos
       6 tunes from /DEMOS/UNKNOWN/ identified
       3 tunes from /GAMES/ identified
      28 tunes moved out of /DEMOS/ to their composers' directories
       5 tunes moved out of /GAMES/ to their composers' directories

HVSC #1 was released today 25 years ago, on 12 July 1996. This is the 75th
update and we made it happen on the same day.
We have witnessed this collection grow exponentially in the years, from only
4,000 sids in the first release, now counts more than 54,000: practically 2,000
new sids were added each year!
Many people joined the C64 scene providing new tunes - sometimes wonderful,
sometimes strange, all special and creative on their own - and, sadly, we also
lost some people, who left us their inheritance before parting.
This release is dedicated to the memory of whose are not anymore with us,
you'll be remembered.


We are always looking for others to help make HVSC a better collection.
If you find any errors or have new rips to add, please email:

 iAN CooG  <hvsc (sid) c64.org>

Thanks to all the people who have helped to make HVSC the collection that it
is today, without your help it would be a much tougher task.

# SIDKick #
###########

SIDKick is a drop-in replacement for the SID sound chips used in C64s and C128s
based on a Teensy 4.1. It is able to emulate two SIDs (6581 and/or 8580) and a
Sound Expander (offering Yamaha OPL-based FM sound) at the same time. The
emulation is based on reSID and fmOPL.

Currently its features include:

- 6581 and/or 8580 emulation based on reSID 0.16 or reSID 1.0 (configurable)
- 2nd-SID address at $d400, $d420, $d500, $d420 + $d500, $de00, $df00
- Sound Expander/FM emulation based on fmOPL (at $df00)
- Paddle/mouse support
- Built-in configuration menu (launch with "SYS 54301")
- Built-in PRG launcher (via menu)
- 10 different profiles, switchable on-the-fly via an optional button
- Sound output via Teensy MQS (PWM) or high-quality using a PT8211/TM8211-DAC,
  filters, and an operational amplifier output available at connectors (stereo)
  or routed through the mainboard (mono)

# ACID 64 Player Pro V4.0.0 #
#############################

A new version of ACID64 has been released. ACID 64 Player is a cycle based
Commodore 64 music player designed for playing SID tunes on external interfaces
that emulate the sound of the SID chip or that consist of a hardware device
that has a real SID chip (6581/8580) on board.

What's new in version 4.0.0:

- Complete rewrite of UI:
  * Tune information with player ID and STIL in one view.
  * STIL view is now responsive and supports emoticons and links.
  * File browser with support of sorting on filename / size.
  * Instant scroll through all HVSC files.
  * Instant search SID files inside HVSC.
  * 5 different sort options in search view.
  * Tune info and player ID in search results.
  * Search on SID header text, path and/or SID filename.
  * Zoom in/out with option to remember the setting.
  * MUS info is now displayed in PETSCII.
  * Go back or forward between already played tunes.
  * Seek through SID tune.
  * Select subtune via popup or via next/previous buttons.
  * Switch between PAL/NTSC playback modes.
  * Toggle voices on/off.
  * Toggle filter on/off.
  * Switch display of voice bars between led / fluent bars.
  * Select different device on the fly without restarting the song.

This version doesn't support HardSID PCI/ISA devices anymore and also hardware
that rely on the hardsid.dll is not supported. For this, version 3.x of ACID64
should be used. Support for the 1541 Ultimate and Ultimate 64 devices will be
added later.

# Sidbang64 #
#############

Sidbang64 is an open source cross-platform loop-sequencer for sid-chip
multispeed sounds. It's made by Sebastian Abel (Warp8).

Most sid-music is made with an update rate once per screen refresh of the video
system (50Hz/60Hz). Sidbang64 runs the player multiple times during a screen
refresh and supports 16 speed which translates to ~800Hz on a PAL system.

Instruments are configured by setting up oscillators for different parameters.
The "sample frequency" of the oscillators is determined by the set multispeed
factor. The interface reflects this by displaying an oscillator frequency (f)
together with the update ticks (t).

Songs can be exported to be played on c64. Currently the export format is
essentially a dump of sid-state changes to keep the replayer fast and simple.

# Music Studio 2.2.0.4 #
########################

Music Studio is an open-source Windows-based SID music creator software. It uses
RESID-FP for SID emulation, both old (6581) and new (8580) SID chips. Music
Studio is capable of creating 1x speed tunes and alternate many SID chip
parameters directly with various commands. Classic and new C64 sounds can be
created with envelope parameters that can be set up in a few simple steps.

Changes in this release:

- The ability to insert instrument positions has been added.
- Fixed an issue where sometimes acme and the supporting sources cannot be found
  by the tool when starting from a msmus file in Explorer.
- Command line conversion and play mode. This allows the tool to be used during
  an automated build, for example load a msmus file, add extra source effect
  files and export as prg.
- When ripping a SID, the AD/SR and first few wav table entries are captured.
- Fixed an issue with desktop zoom level and high resolution displays.
- A moving average calculation for raster time has been added.
- A millis/seconds/minutes timer has been added.

# VICE 3.5 #
############

VICE 3.5 has been released. VICE is an open source cross-platform emulator of
several Commodore machines.

VICE also includes VSID which can be used to play SID files.

SID/Audio related changes:

- Fixed the filter saturation.
- Noise writeback fixes.
- Envelope regression fix.
- Fix the coefficients for the resid external filter.
- Rough implementation of the shift register and waveform zero bitfade.
- Support of 4 additional SID chips for a total of 8 (x64*/xscpu64/x128 only).
- Emulator timing is now directly driven by the host system audio device.
  If sound emulation is disabled, timing is synchronized with the host clock.
  As part of this change, the choice of sound synchronization method has been
  removed.
- Audio latency is much lower on all platforms, and new lower latency defaults
  have been set. Users are encouraged to try using smaller fragment sizes and
  experiment with finding the lowest stable buffer size on their system.

# SID Known v1.21 #
###################

Wilfred Bos has released SID Known v1.21. This version supports now HVSC #75.
SID Known is a command line tool which you can use to identify SID tunes from
SID and PRG files.

This tool can be used if e.g. you want to know which SID tune is used in a
specific C64 demo or C64 game, or you have a SID tune found or ripped and you
want to know if it is already in your SID collection.

SID Known can be used to identify music but it also helps to find out which
tunes are not in the High Voltage SID Collection. If you find music not found
by SID Known, it would be appreciated if you report this to the HVSC crew
(https://hvsc.de) or post it in one of the CSDb forums (https://csdb.dk) like
"SIDs that aren't in HVSC yet".
