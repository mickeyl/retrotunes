High Voltage SID Collection Update 56
Date: December 23, 2011

Resulting Version: 56
 Previous Version: 55

Hello fellow lover of SID music!
Nice you found some time to read through this script, to see what has been
changed in the HVSC and for what reason.


After this update, the collection should contain 41,250 SID files!

This update features (all approximates):
     861 new SIDs
     156 fixed/better rips
      14 PlaySID/Sidplay1 specific SIDs eliminated
      11 repeats/bad rips eliminated
     786 SID credit fixes
      88 SID model/clock infos
      31 tunes from /DEMOS/UNKNOWN/ identified
      12 tunes from /GAMES/ identified
      51 tunes moved out of /DEMOS/ to their composers' directories
      28 tunes moved out of /GAMES/ to their composers' directories
     300 new STIL entries

We are always looking for others to help make HVSC a better collection.
If you find any errors or have new rips to add, please email:

 iAN CooG  <hvsc@c64.org>


Thanks to all the people who have helped to make HVSC the
collection that it is today, without your help it would be
a much tougher task.

# SID Known v1.03 #
###################

Wilfred Bos has released SID Known v1.03. This version supports now HVSC #56.
SID Known is a command line tool which you can use to identify SID tunes from
SID and PRG files.

This tool can be used if e.g. you want to know which SID tune is used in a
specific C64 demo or C64 game, or you have a SID tune found or ripped and you
want to know if it is already in your SID collection.

SID Known can be used to identify music but it also helps to find out which
tunes are not in the High Voltage SID Collection. If you find music not found
by SID Known, it would be appreciated if you report this to the HVSC crew
(http://hvsc.de) or post it in one of the CSDb forums (http://csdb.dk) like
"SIDs that aren't in HVSC yet".

# MICRO64 #
###########

MICRO64 is a new Commodore 64 emulator for Windows and Linux aimed to become
the most accurate C64 emulator. Currently micro64 has two different VIC II
emulation modes (both are half-cycle exact):

* single pixel dot clock exact (very accurate, slow)
* dynamic pixel block-wise (quite fast, even on slower machines).

MICRO64 is under heavy development and is updated regularly.
