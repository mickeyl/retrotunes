# SidCore #
###########

SidCore, developed by DeepCore, is a SID player for the Commodore 64. It
operates by replacing the standard Kernel with a custom one that integrates the
SID player code in place of the RS232 routines. The player exclusively supports
SID files with the V2NG header and tunes located within the memory range of
$0800 to $CFFF. When a compatible SID file is loaded into RAM, SidCore detects
the header and seamlessly plays the tune.

# SID Known v1.28 #
###################

Wilfred Bos has released a new version of SID Known. This version supports now
HVSC #82. SID Known is a command line tool which you can use to identify SID
tunes from SID and PRG files.

This tool can be used if e.g., you want to know which SID tune is used in a
specific C64 demo or C64 game, or you have a SID tune found or ripped and you
want to know if it is already in your SID collection.

SID Known can be used to identify music but it also helps to find out which
tunes are not in the High Voltage SID Collection. If you find music not found
by SID Known, it would be appreciated if you report this to the HVSC crew
(https://hvsc.de) or post it in one of the CSDb forums (https://csdb.dk) like
"SIDs that aren't in HVSC yet".
