High Voltage SID Collection: Update #68
Date: December 23, 2017

Resulting Version: 68
 Previous Version: 67

After this update, the collection should contain 50,240 SID files!

This update features (all approximates):
     700 new SIDs
     222 fixed/better rips
       2 repeats/bad rips eliminated
     327 SID credit fixes
      20 SID model/clock infos
       3 tunes from /DEMOS/UNKNOWN/ identified
       1 tunes from /GAMES/ identified
      24 tunes moved out of /DEMOS/ to their composers' directories
       0 tunes moved out of /GAMES/ to their composers' directories

We finally broke another record: the major milestone of 50,000 SIDs has
been reached. Don't even think that's enough, as there's always new and old
tunes to be discovered every day.
Starting with this update we're offering 2 new ways of calculating and
reading song lengths infos, please refer to DOCUMENTS/Songlengths.faq

We are always looking for others to help make HVSC a better collection.
If you find any errors or have new rips to add, please email:

 iAN CooG  <hvsc (sid) c64.org>

Thanks to all the people who have helped to make HVSC the collection that it
is today, without your help it would be a much tougher task.

# C64 reloaded MK2 #
####################

The Commodore 64 Reloaded MK2 is a C64 Motherboard for building a C64 on your
own. The board is shipped with empty ZIF sockets for the key chips such as CPU,
port chips, sound/video chips. All other components are already assembled and
pre-tested.

There are two sockets on the board for holding 2 types of SID chips. This makes
it ideal for playing stereo SID tunes and mono SID tunes on the preferred SID
model.

Via USB the board can be configured and mono/stereo settings for the SID chips
can be stored. Also, the second SID chip's address can be configured and set to
D420, D500, DE00 or it can be configured to both D420 and D500.

# SIDdecompiler 0.5 #
#####################

SIDdecompiler is written by Stein Pedersen/Prosonix. This program takes a SID
file and runs it through a 6502 emulator to produce a relocatable assembler
source file. The output is very simple and should work with most assemblers,
like e.g. 64tass.

# CGSC v1.34 #

# Ultimate 64 #
###############

The Ultimate 64 is a new main board for your beloved C64 case. This board is a
hardware implementation (FPGA) of the entire C64, and it includes the
Ultimate-II+ cartridge as well. An all-in-one solution.

Since it has the Ultimate-II+ cartridge built in, there is also a SID Player
built in which can be used to play SID tunes. The SID Player will get an update
to make it possible to select sub tunes via the keyboard and it will be
possible to display song length info with a time bar.

The board supports real SID chips, the 6581 as well as the 8580 SID chip. It has
two sockets for the SID chips. With jumpers the voltage for these chips is set,
as well as the external filter components.

The board also supports SID emulation so that is can produce audio without the
need of a real SID chip. Since it supports multiple SID chips, it is possible to
play stereo SID tunes. The address of any of the SID chips is configurable.

The output of the SIDs is digitized on the board and the digital samples are
merged with the video into the HDMI stream.

# Prg2Sid 0.97 #
################

Prg2Sid is a tool that attaches a PSID header to a ripped (prg) tune. It
identifies some players and sets init/play accordingly. It also patches
the header and code if needed.

Since 0.90 the following has been changed:

- new players identified:
  Burgstaller v1/v2/v3/v4 (slight differences in init)
  Deflemask v2/v12 (adds JMPs at $1000 when possible)
  Digitronix
  SkylineTech/Danne (automatic remap of $01xx buffer to $02xx)
- Cybertracker/EXE, removed JSR $4D00 (rasterbars), reported by Groepaz.
- Future Composer 4.x (packed), automatic remap of $01xx buffer to $02xx, makes
  GRG's SidPlay64 happy.
- Parsec/LoS: added 1 variant with slightly offset code.
- Winterberg, added $dc04 setting.

# defMON V20171026 #
####################

defMON is a music editor for the Commodore 64.

Some features of this editor:

- Power through simplicity and flexibility.
- defMON doesn't make a distinction between 'instruments' and 'effects'.
  Instead all control of sound is handled through the same sound editing table,
  where you can make small snippets of sound settings.
- In each step of the sequences you can execute two different sidtab chunks at
  the same time. This can be used to vary settings in a chunk without having to
  create duplicates of instrument like chunks, or it can be used as if it was
  some sort of effect (e.g. slide or vibrato), and so forth.
- Support for multi speed tunes: 1x, 2x, 4x and 8x.
- Stereo SID support.
- Relatively low CPU usage.

Bug fixes:
- SHIFT+N was broken and accidentally disabled.
- Pattern was broken in unused sequences when saving and then loading a tune.

New:
- SHIFT+U has now been changed to work also in stereo SID mode.
- The state of the filter is now displayed correctly in the sequence edit
  screen. This visualization now also works in 2sid mode.

  modify them to avoid garbage characters to be displayed.

# SID Known v1.14 #
###################

Wilfred Bos has released SID Known v1.14. This version supports now HVSC #68.
SID Known is a command line tool which you can use to identify SID tunes from
SID and PRG files.

This tool can be used if e.g. you want to know which SID tune is used in a
specific C64 demo or C64 game, or you have a SID tune found or ripped and you
want to know if it is already in your SID collection.

SID Known can be used to identify music but it also helps to find out which
tunes are not in the High Voltage SID Collection. If you find music not found
by SID Known, it would be appreciated if you report this to the HVSC crew
(http://hvsc.de) or post it in one of the CSDb forums (http://csdb.dk) like
"SIDs that aren't in HVSC yet".
