o Motion joined the HVSC Crew

o Steppe retired from the HVSC admin post. Rambones will take over,
  good luck!

o The new directory structure requires a new update tool. It got updated
  for Linux and Windows, so we feel the majority of users won't have a problem.
  For the exotic platform users: The source code of update tool 2.8.4 is
  on the HVSC website in the Downloads section. If you manage to compile it
  on your specific platform, feel free to send it over!
  And by the way: You can still run update #47 with update tool 2.8.3.
  It will complain heavily that the /Hubbard_Rob/ directory is not where it
  expects it to be, thus assuming you did something fundamentally wrong.
  Just ignore the warning, nod away the next "y/n are you sure you're sure?"
  question and it will work anyway.

o STIL Bonus released
  For all you STIL junkies out there curious about some of the module
  tunes mentioned in the STIL, the HVSC team now offers the STIL Bonus:
  
  http://www.prg.dtu.dk/HVSC/STIL_Bonus/

  The STIL Bonus is a collection of MODs, XMs, MP3s, and other assorted
  tunes referenced in the STIL.  This collection was previously available
  under a different name (MCOT 64) but on a much smaller scale.  The
  collection is now 63MBs compressed, and offers some very memorable game
  and scene tunes from the Amiga, PC, and other sources.

  The collection was put together in order for the HVSC team to verify
  several STIL entries for correctness.  We then thought it would be a
  nice collection that the public may also enjoy.  For some of you, you
  may have never heard these tunes.  For others, it may be a trip down
  nostalgia lane. You may even find that you actually prefer some of the
  SID versions while for other cases the modules/MP3 will be preferable.


o PSID64 v0.8 is out!
  The popular .sid->.prg converter saw another update. New features include:
    * Built-in support for Exomizer.
    * Added support for a joystick in port two to control the player.
    * Added clock to indicated running time.
    * Added -i option to override the initial song to play.
    * Added support for SID tunes written in BASIC.
  Grab it here:  http://psid64.sourceforge.net/




We are always looking for others to help make HVSC a better
collection.  If you find any errors or have new rips to add, please
