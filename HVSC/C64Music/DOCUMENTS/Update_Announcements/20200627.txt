# defMON V20200601 #
####################

defMON is a music editor for the Commodore 64.

Changes in this release:

- Fixed a bug in the packer where the packer tried to follow jumps in the sidtab
  to see which rows were used/unused. The bug caused the packer to fail in some
  cases when jumps were involved, so the packed tune would get corrupted.
* The loop-jump command in the sequence list wasn't initialized properly when
  restarting a tune. This should now be fixed.
* A minor fix to SHIFT+U (copy current sequence to next unused sequence) to make
  sure that parameters to jump commands (FF XX XX) aren't misinterpreted.

control how the results are displayed and what data is being matched. Also, a
command can be executed with the matching SID file(s) as parameter, for example
to play it, etc.

Changes since version 0.8.0:

- Improved compatibility with older Perl versions (thanks to djinn/wd for patch
  and suggestions!) and adds support for HVSC_BASE environment variable for
  setting the HVSC location.
- Check for "$HOME/.stilgrep.cfg" instead of "$HOME/stilgrep.cfg".
- Outputs the matches for all fields, not just the first one.

# SID Known v1.19 #
###################

Wilfred Bos has released SID Known v1.19. This version supports now HVSC #73.
SID Known is a command line tool which you can use to identify SID tunes from
SID and PRG files.

This tool can be used if e.g. you want to know which SID tune is used in a
specific C64 demo or C64 game, or you have a SID tune found or ripped and you
want to know if it is already in your SID collection.

SID Known can be used to identify music but it also helps to find out which
tunes are not in the High Voltage SID Collection. If you find music not found
by SID Known, it would be appreciated if you report this to the HVSC crew
(https://hvsc.de) or post it in one of the CSDb forums (https://csdb.dk) like
"SIDs that aren't in HVSC yet".
