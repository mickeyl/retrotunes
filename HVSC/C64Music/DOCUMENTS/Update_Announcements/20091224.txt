Hello fellow lover of SID music!
Nice you found some time to read through this script, to see what has been
changed in the HVSC and for what reason.


After this update, the collection should contain 37,801 SID files!

This update features (all approximates):
     874 new SIDs
      65 fixed/better rips
       0 PlaySID/Sidplay1 specific SIDs eliminated
      12 repeats/bad rips eliminated
     470 SID credit fixes
     174 SID model/clock infos
      17 tunes from /DEMOS/UNKNOWN/ identified
       2 tunes from /GAMES/ identified
      25 tunes moved out of /DEMOS/ to their composers' directories
       4 tunes moved out of /GAMES/ to their composers' directories


We are always looking for others to help make HVSC a better collection. If you
find any errors or have new rips to add, please email:

 Jan Harries, iAN CooG  <hvsc@c64.org>


Thanks to all the people who have helped to make HVSC the
collection that it is today, without your help it would be
a much tougher task.

Most important (sound/sid emulation) changes since the last version include:

- Sound core has been reworked to enable lower latency of operation.
  Approximately 50 ms latency values are now routinely reached, and some
  people have reported that as low as 30 ms still works for them.

- ReSID's resampler has been optimized with MMX assembly. Some long-standing
  bugs in resample-interpolate mode were also fixed.

- ReSID-FP has been optimized, too. It clocks the analog parts at half the
  rate now, which saves CPU during filter emulation especially for 6581 modes.

- Added SFX Sound Sampler and SFX Sound Expander emulation.

- Stereo SID $D7xx range support. (x128)

- Replaced old DTVSID emulation with ReSID-DTV. (x64dtv)

- Rudimentary PulseAudio sound driver has been added.

- Added experimental PCI HardSID and Catweasel support. (Amiga port)

- Used AROS (x86, ppc, amd64) new lowlevel libraries which should make USB
  joysticks and joypads usable.

- The CoreAudio sound driver was completely rewritten to support the updated
  sound APIs found in the new Mac OS X versions. (MacOSX port)
