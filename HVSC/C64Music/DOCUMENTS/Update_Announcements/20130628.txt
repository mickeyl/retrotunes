Hello fellow lover of SID music!
Nice you found some time to read through this script, to see what has been
changed in the HVSC and for what reason.

After this update, the collection should contain 43,856 SID files!

This update features (all approximates):
     747 new SIDs
     315 fixed/better rips
       7 repeats/bad rips eliminated
     629 SID credit fixes
     750 SID model/clock infos
       9 tunes from /DEMOS/UNKNOWN/ identified
       5 tunes from /GAMES/ identified
      27 tunes moved out of /DEMOS/ to their composers' directories
      15 tunes moved out of /GAMES/ to their composers' directories

We are always looking for others to help make HVSC a better collection.
If you find any errors or have new rips to add, please email:

 iAN CooG  <hvsc (sid) c64.org>


Thanks to all the people who have helped to make HVSC the
collection that it is today, without your help it would be
a much tougher task.

# SID Known v1.06 #
###################

Wilfred Bos has released SID Known v1.06. This version supports now HVSC #59.
SID Known is a command line tool which you can use to identify SID tunes from
SID and PRG files.

This tool can be used if e.g. you want to know which SID tune is used in a
specific C64 demo or C64 game, or you have a SID tune found or ripped and you
want to know if it is already in your SID collection.

SID Known can be used to identify music but it also helps to find out which
tunes are not in the High Voltage SID Collection. If you find music not found
by SID Known, it would be appreciated if you report this to the HVSC crew
(http://hvsc.de) or post it in one of the CSDb forums (http://csdb.dk) like
"SIDs that aren't in HVSC yet".

Two new features has been added in this release. For binary searches, you will
now be notified when there are multiple matches found for the same hit
percentage. Also you will now be notified when the match that is found might
not be reliable.
