idunSID is a server daemon for streaming SID tunes to the idun-cartridge from a
remote client machine. It runs as a service on the idun-cartridge to allow SID
tunes to be played from a client over the network, using either emulated sound
or the real SID chip in your Commodore.

# SoedeSoft SIDMaster 1.4 #
###########################

Version 1.4 of SIDMaster has been released.

SIDmaster is a virtual synthesizer for the popular DAW: Reason. It emulates the
SID 6581 or SID 8580 sound chip of the popular Commodore 64 home computer of the
eighties and nineties.

SIDMaster is made by SoedeSoft who also made the music editor SoundMaster on the
Commodore 64 in the 80s.

Changes since version 1.3:

- Minor sound quality improvements (noise filter and subsampling)
- Pulse ENV button added, when selected, pulse LFO will never restart at a new
  note
- more wave effects and patches

# ARMSID firmware 2.15 #
########################

A new firmware update has been released for the ARMSID and ARM2SID.

ARMSID/ARM2SID is a replacement of the MOS6581 and MOS8580 sound chip used in
the Commodore C64. It is minimalistic (in simplicity of circuit and use, not in
function and power).

The following has been changed in the firmware:

- Fixed a bug with noise generation in the highest octave (reported for example
  in Crossroads II and Jumpman).
- SID type detection returns the actual model from the ARMSID configuration
- Fixed bad music timing in Turrican 2 - The Final Fight (audible in track 2).
- Added undocumented playback of the "no" waveform, making e.g., the Boing Boom
  Tschak whistle significantly less (about 20dB down).
- Modifications in the generation of combined waveforms (not only) for MOS8580
  emulation, where they are more close to the original (as close as possible for
  chips that are themselves different from each other, also dependent on
  temperature, voltage and time).

# SID Known v1.25 #
###################

Wilfred Bos has released SID Known v1.25. This version supports now HVSC #79.
SID Known is a command line tool which you can use to identify SID tunes from
SID and PRG files.

This tool can be used if e.g., you want to know which SID tune is used in a
specific C64 demo or C64 game, or you have a SID tune found or ripped and you
want to know if it is already in your SID collection.

SID Known can be used to identify music but it also helps to find out which
tunes are not in the High Voltage SID Collection. If you find music not found
by SID Known, it would be appreciated if you report this to the HVSC crew
(https://hvsc.de) or post it in one of the CSDb forums (https://csdb.dk) like
"SIDs that aren't in HVSC yet".
