# SoedeSoft SidMaster #
#######################

SIDmaster is a virtual synthesizer for the popular DAW: Reason. It emulates the
SID 6581 or SID 8580 sound chip of the popular Commodore 64 home computer of the
eighties and nineties.

SIDMaster is made by SoedeSoft who also made the music editor SoundMaster on the
Commodore 64 in the 80s.

Although SIDMaster looks compact and doesn't take much space in your rack, all
registers of each of the 3 voices can be controlled simultaneously.

Besides simply emulating the SID chip, it also implements all kinds of effects
that were popular in the days when musicians made game or demo tunes for the
C64, to get greater sounds.

Features:

The C64 6581 SID chip has 3 voices, each voice has:

- Attack Decay Sustain Release control.
- Waveform selection (triangle, sawtooth, pulse, noise, or any combination)
- Pulse width can be modulated by the control wheel.
- Built-in arpeggiator, which can be different per voice
- Waveform effects (alternates waveforms/frequencies sequentially)
- Ring modulation and sync options (modulates / syncs one voice with another)
- Note transpose and detune

One filter which can be enabled per voice:

- It can be configured as lowpass, highpass, bandpass or notch filter
- Cutoff frequency, and resonance, which can be modulated by the control wheel
  and velocity.
- Resonance can be modulated with the control wheel.
- LFOs for the pulse width, frequency of each voice and one LFO for the filter.

Play modes are:

- Monophone: use all 3 voices simultaneously to create richer, layered sound
- Polyphone: operate as a 3-voice polyphonic synthesizer.
- Keyboard control: pitch bend, legato / slide

# ARMSID firmware 2.12  #
# ARM2SID firmware 3.12 #
#########################

A new firmware update has been released for the ARMSID and ARM2SID.

ARMSID/ARM2SID is a replacement of the MOS6581 and MOS8580 sound chip used in
the Commodore C64. It is minimalistic (in simplicity of circuit and use, not in
function and power).

The following has been changed:

- Fixed setting of the lowest filter frequency for MOS6581 emulation (sometimes
  the simulation did not match the settings).
- Digifix in MOS8580 emulation is now configurable.
- Fixed inner analog offsets in the MOS6581 emulation.
- A small fix in tone counters updates in the fast changes.
- Faster release of the data bus after reading cycle.
- Fixed a bug from older versions in the values generation of the register OSC3
  during a noise waveform.

# TitchySID  #
##############

TitchySID is a music player based on TinySID. It is written in MASM32 and it can
play SID chiptunes from the Commodore 64.

It currently only supports PSID format files, but other formats will be added in
the future. It aims to be the smallest SID player library available which can be
added easily to any development project on Microsoft platforms.

TitchySID can be downloaded here:

https://github.com/Stat-Mat/TitchySID


###########################################
# WebSid (WebAudio version of Tiny'R'Sid) #
###########################################

WebSid is a JavaScript/WebAudio based C64 emulator / music player. It allows to
play .mus and RSID/PSID format *.sid music files. 

The emulator logic is written in C/C++. This code is then cross-compiled into a
JavaScript library suitable for the Web.

WebSid is also used by online players like DeepSid and SIDAMP.

A couple of changes were made recently:

- CIA/IRQ/NMI implementation now passes Wolfgang Lorenz's 6502 test suite.
- Performance improvements to make the emulator significantly faster. Depending
  on the song played, CPU load reduction for single SID songs is between 33-50%.

# defMON V20200918 #
####################

defMON is a music editor for the Commodore 64.

Changes in this release:

- When muting voices in 2SID mode, the visual representation of which channels
  that are currently on/off was incorrect (e.g. muting VOC0 for SID1 would make
  the label VOC0 disappear for SID2 as well.).

# SID Known v1.20 #
###################

Wilfred Bos has released SID Known v1.20. This version supports now HVSC #74.
SID Known is a command line tool which you can use to identify SID tunes from
SID and PRG files.

This tool can be used if e.g. you want to know which SID tune is used in a
specific C64 demo or C64 game, or you have a SID tune found or ripped and you
want to know if it is already in your SID collection.

SID Known can be used to identify music but it also helps to find out which
tunes are not in the High Voltage SID Collection. If you find music not found
by SID Known, it would be appreciated if you report this to the HVSC crew
(https://hvsc.de) or post it in one of the CSDb forums (https://csdb.dk) like
"SIDs that aren't in HVSC yet".
