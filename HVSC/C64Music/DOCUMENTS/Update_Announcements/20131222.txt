High Voltage SID Collection: Update #60
Date: December 22, 2013

Resulting Version: 60
 Previous Version: 59

After this update, the collection should contain 44,670 SID files!

This update features (all approximates):
     825 new SIDs
     233 fixed/better rips
      11 repeats/bad rips eliminated
     910 SID credit fixes
     120 SID model/clock infos
      24 tunes from /DEMOS/UNKNOWN/ identified
       8 tunes from /GAMES/ identified
      60 tunes moved out of /DEMOS/ to their composers' directories
       7 tunes moved out of /GAMES/ to their composers' directories

Another milestone reached: 44,000+ SIDs thanks to the never ending love
from the C64 scene that still produces an amazing quantity of great tunes
for our endless hunger for bleepy music. Keep this spirit alive!

We are always looking for others to help make HVSC a better collection.
If you find any errors or have new rips to add, please email:

Thanks to all the people who have helped to make HVSC the collection that
it is today, without your help it would be a much tougher task.

# SID Fixer #

The SID Fixer is a small circuit board for installation inside your C64 or 128.
It allows you to mount both an old and a new SID at the same time. This gives
you the opportunity to manually switch between the two chips on-the-fly, but it
also enables music player software to automatically select and use the
appropriate SID.

# SID Known v1.07 #
###################

Wilfred Bos has released SID Known v1.07. This version supports now HVSC #60.
SID Known is a command line tool which you can use to identify SID tunes from
SID and PRG files.

This tool can be used if e.g. you want to know which SID tune is used in a
specific C64 demo or C64 game, or you have a SID tune found or ripped and you
want to know if it is already in your SID collection.

SID Known can be used to identify music but it also helps to find out which
tunes are not in the High Voltage SID Collection. If you find music not found
by SID Known, it would be appreciated if you report this to the HVSC crew
(http://hvsc.de) or post it in one of the CSDb forums (http://csdb.dk) like
"SIDs that aren't in HVSC yet".
