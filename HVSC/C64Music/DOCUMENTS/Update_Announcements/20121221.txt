     185 fixed/better rips
       2 repeats/bad rips eliminated
     971 SID credit fixes
     111 SID model/clock infos
      13 tunes from /DEMOS/UNKNOWN/ identified
      14 tunes from /GAMES/ identified

      14 tunes moved out of /GAMES/ to their composers' directories

We are always looking for others to help make HVSC a better collection.

- Adjusted SID bus read behavior for "Last Ninja 3" for the case if no 1351
  mouse is enabled.
- Fixed SID digi boost
- Fixed SID SINC resampling
- "SSEized" SID SINC resampling and prepared these code parts for
  "AVXiziation"
- Updated PSID driver
- Fixed bugs and implemented new features in the SID player mode
- Fixed a small bug in the song switching routine in the SID player mode,
  which was happened only at PSIDv2 SID files with C64 compatible mode flags
  state

# SID Known v1.05 #
###################

Wilfred Bos has released SID Known v1.05. This version supports now HVSC #58.
SID Known is a command line tool which you can use to identify SID tunes from
SID and PRG files.

This tool can be used if e.g. you want to know which SID tune is used in a
specific C64 demo or C64 game, or you have a SID tune found or ripped and you
want to know if it is already in your SID collection.

SID Known can be used to identify music but it also helps to find out which
tunes are not in the High Voltage SID Collection. If you find music not found
by SID Known, it would be appreciated if you report this to the HVSC crew
(http://hvsc.de) or post it in one of the CSDb forums (http://csdb.dk) like
"SIDs that aren't in HVSC yet".
