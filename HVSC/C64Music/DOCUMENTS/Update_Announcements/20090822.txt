# HardSID 4U Winamp Plugin v1.0.0.1 #
#####################################

HardSID 4U Winamp plug-in v1.0.0.1 has been released.

It has one new feature: It does not require a local HVSC download at all.
(while still supports a local copy of course)
It downloads the song length database and the STIL database from the
internet automatically in a few seconds the first time you run the plugin.

New HardSID users only have to install the HardSID driver and the Winamp
plugin and then they can start searching/playing the whole HVSC immediately
at http://c64jukebox.hardsid.com with song-length and STIL support.

# GoatTracker 2.68 / Mac OS X #
###############################

From Andreas Varga (MrSID) a new port of the SID composing program.
Quoted from his site <http://www.sidmusic.org/goattracker/mac/>

"
After a really long time doing other things, I've finally decided to adapt
another version of GoatTracker for Mac OS X. Many things have changed and
GoatTracker has definitely matured into a state-of-the-art C64 music editor.

This time around, the Mac OS X integration is much more complete, offering
standard keyboard shortcuts, built-in help windows, and open/save dialogs for
songs and instruments. There's more room for future improvements though. If
you're actively using GoatTracker, please let me know of any ideas and
suggestions you might have.

# Hoxs 1.0.5.27 #
#################

The new version is optimized to run slightly faster most of the time.

Also, it closes the 1.0.5.x branch started in October 2007. There are several
VIC-II findings that haven't made it into the emu yet, but they will have to
wait for the new debugger in v1.0.6.0, which should allow to improve the
emulation more efficiently.

13 August 2009 v1.0.5.27
========================
1) Added general option to enable/disable opposing joystick directions.

2) Speed optimisation to the CPU, CIA and VIC. The emulation is noticeable
   faster on lines with no DMA fetches and no IRQs

3) Bug fix to the reverse keyboard matrix. Was broken for years!

4) Accurate emulation of the $DD00 VIC bank switch bug.

Unless something is majorly broken, the next release will include the long
awaited debugger. Work on the debugger is now in progress.

# HVMEC 0.9 #
#############

Quoted from the Lemon64 announcement by Ice00:

"
After very very long time, a new version of HVMEC (High Voltage Music Engine
Collection) is ready to download.

This version comes with 31 new music programs, for a total of 140 editors, 84
trackers, 70 other tools.

The good thing is that other 50 programs are ready to be released (but this
will be done some time in the future) and others are adding. With this version
Stephan Parth is now a co-author of the collection as he did most of the hard
work.

The collection can be viewed online or downloaded from:
http://digilander.libero.it/ice00/tsid/hvmec.html

I also try to create a torrent for helping in download:
http://utenti.lycos.it/ice00/hvmec-0.9-all.tar.bz2.torrent

From scratch I start even this Wordpress version of HVMEC:
http://hvmec.hellospace.net/blog
(takes it as a alpha preliminary version). Now it has only 2 editors in it
(just to see that the system can work), a simple layout, and it will take at
least a year to add all other editors present into actual HVMEC.

The advantage of this methods is that I can add more contributors and they can
add/modify editors by themself and else subscribed people to RSS Feed can see
in realtime the new added editors.
