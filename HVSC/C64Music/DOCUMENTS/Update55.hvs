# High Voltage SID Collection: Update #55
# Date: June 25, 2011
#
# Resulting Version: 55
#  Previous Version: 54
#
# Hello fellow lover of SID music!
# Nice you found some time to read through this script, to see what has been
# changed in the HVSC and for what reason.
#
# After this update, the collection should contain 40,400 SID files!
#
# This update features (all approximates):
#      804 new SIDs (62 2SIDs)
#      113 fixed/better rips
#        4 PlaySID/Sidplay1 specific SIDs eliminated
#       30 repeats/bad rips eliminated
#      742 SID credit fixes
#      176 SID model/clock infos
#       16 tunes from /DEMOS/UNKNOWN/ identified
#        4 tunes from /GAMES/ identified
#       36 tunes moved out of /DEMOS/ to their composers' directories
#        2 tunes moved out of /GAMES/ to their composers' directories
#
# Please note that from this update we've introduced PSID v3 format to allow
# SID files meant to be played in stereo, and the 31 character limit on the
# text fields AUTHOR, TITLE, RELEASED of SID files has been relaxed, allowing
# now all 32 chars to be used. Also filename length limit is completely gone,
# to allow filenames longer than 32 characters.
#
# We are always looking for others to help make HVSC a better
# collection.  If you find any errors or have new rips to add, please
# email:
