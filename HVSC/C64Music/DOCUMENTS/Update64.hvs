# Hello fellow lover of SID music!

#       12 tunes moved out of /GAMES/ to their composers' directories
#
# Merry HVSCmas SID fans, here we are with the 2nd favourite update of the year
# with the usual loads of recently made tunes, old scavenged ones and tons of
# better SID rips to keep you busy during the cold winter holidays.
# Another milestone has been reached with 47,500 tunes, with a total of 650
# made this year. Amazing.
# This update is dedicated to Ramos/HVSC^Samar who suddenly passed away in
# August, at the young age of 39. Thanks for everything, rest in peace and see
# you in another life.
#
# We are always looking for others to help make HVSC a better collection.
# If you find any errors or have new rips to add, please email:
