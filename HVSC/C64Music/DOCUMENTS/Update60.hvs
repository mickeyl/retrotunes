# High Voltage SID Collection: Update #60
# Date: December 22, 2013
#
# Resulting Version: 60
#  Previous Version: 59
#
# Hello fellow lover of SID music!
# Nice you found some time to read through this script, to see what has been
# changed in the HVSC and for what reason.
#
# After this update, the collection should contain 44,670 SID files!
#
# This update features (all approximates):
#      825 new SIDs
#      233 fixed/better rips
#       11 repeats/bad rips eliminated
#      910 SID credit fixes
#      120 SID model/clock infos
#       24 tunes from /DEMOS/UNKNOWN/ identified
#        8 tunes from /GAMES/ identified
#       60 tunes moved out of /DEMOS/ to their composers' directories
#        7 tunes moved out of /GAMES/ to their composers' directories
#
# Another milestone reached: 44,000+ SIDs thanks to the never ending love
# from the C64 scene that still produces an amazing quantity of great tunes
# for our endless hunger for bleepy music. Keep this spirit alive!
#
# We are always looking for others to help make HVSC a better
# collection.  If you find any errors or have new rips to add, please
# email:
