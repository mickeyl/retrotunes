# High Voltage SID Collection: Update #63
# Date: June 27, 2015
#
# Resulting Version: 63
#  Previous Version: 62
#
# Hello fellow lover of SID music!
# Nice you found some time to read through this script, to see what has been
# changed in the HVSC and for what reason.
#
# After this update, the collection should contain 46,851 SID files!
#
# This update features (all approximates):
#      798 new SIDs
#      121 fixed/better rips
#        3 repeats/bad rips eliminated
#      412 SID credit fixes
#       67 SID model/clock infos
#        8 tunes from /DEMOS/UNKNOWN/ identified
#       19 tunes from /GAMES/ identified
#       24 tunes moved out of /DEMOS/ to their composers' directories
#       22 tunes moved out of /GAMES/ to their composers' directories
#
# It's summertime again, and as usual it's HVSC Update time aswell! More and
# more new SID music is being produced everyday and as usual we are glad to
# collect and bring them all to you, adding some corrections as we find them
# or when we are reported about fixes to do.
# Introducing 3SIDs from this release. See DOCUMENTS/SID_file_format.txt for
# the specifications about new SID v4 file format. An updated SID player is
# required. Known players which are already supporting the new format are:
# ACID64 v3.6, JSIDPlay2 v3.6, VICE/VSID v2.4.20 rev. 29809.
#
# We are always looking for others to help make HVSC a better
# collection.  If you find any errors or have new rips to add, please
# email:
