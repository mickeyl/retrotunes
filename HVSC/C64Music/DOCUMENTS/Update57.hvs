#       72 tunes moved out of /DEMOS/ to their composers' directories
#       24 tunes moved out of /GAMES/ to their composers' directories
#
# We are always looking for others to help make HVSC a better

# These tunes are replacements for the versions currently
# in HVSC.  This could be for various reasons such as
# more sub-tunes, fixing a speed problem, 100% rip, etc.
