Welcome to the biggest collection of

The whole collection was inspired by
the HVSC collection. We hope you'll

Help!
~~~~~
As you can see, there are lots of songs
in the 'Unknown' directory. If you can
provide us with any missing informatio
about any song (who did it, where does
it come from, when was it composed),
please let us know immediately so that
we can complete the information about
the song in ASMA (and move it to the 
ppropriate directory). We would welcome
if you sent us also the binary file (or
an ATR/XFD disk image) with the
original piece of software with that
song.
